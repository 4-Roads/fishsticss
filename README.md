Fishsticss
==========

Fishsticss takes your old school CSS files and converts them to beautiful, functional LESS files.

The class features an array of useful regex patterns, and a function that takes a string of CSS code and a set of options and then returns beautifully formatted LESS, SASS, SCSS, or CSS.
